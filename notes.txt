---------------------------------

To Do:

- Schedule daily backups of database and price table

- Request higher limit from PSA API

- Create PSA table, start requesting info on cards (current limit is 100 / day)

- Find missing tcg_ids for cards (about 250)

- Display PSA info on individual card pages

- Make card art larger for individual card pages

- Ebay API (Get links for individual cards, display on card profiles)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Collections: 

- Personal collections should be in the user's profile page, not on the home page

- Make user profile more stylish

- Display pricing on personal collections

- If a card has multiple type (for pricing), it will ask the user what type the card is (foil, etc.)

USER ACCOUNTS: 

Short Term: Use temporary hard-coded values (like setting is_admin=True for testing) so you can build and test 
other features, such as the collection functionality.

Medium Term: Once your core features are stable, implement a basic registration and login system (using Flaskâ€‘Login, as we discussed). 
This will let you test admin versus regular user behavior under realistic conditions.

Long Term: Fully integrate the account system with proper security (hashed passwords, database user management, etc.) and a robust admin panel.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Later Ideas: 
- Create a binder/pokemon card collection. Select bind size (such as 4x5) and number of pages.
Pick cards from the database to organize your collection and decide how you want to display your collection

- News section for new releases (including other languages). Also posts for "Card list for set revealed!"
